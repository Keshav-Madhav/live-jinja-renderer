## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-20

### Changed
- **Variable Extraction Behavior**: Variables are no longer automatically extracted on every template change
  - Initial load: Variables are automatically extracted when first opening a file
  - Switching files: Variables are automatically extracted for each new file
